Directory: Model Weights for D-SAV360 Dataset Videos
----------------------------------------------------

Description:
-------------
This directory contains model weights saved as '.pth' files. Each model is trained to overfit a specific video from the D-SAV360 dataset. The naming convention of each file indicates the video ID it corresponds to.

Contents:
---------
- *.pth files: These files are the saved weights of the models. Each file is named according to the ID of the video from the D-SAV360 dataset that the model was trained on.

File Naming Convention:
-----------------------
The naming convention for the files is as follows:

    <video_id>.pth

Where <video_id> is the ID of the video from the D-SAV360 dataset. For example:
    0002.pth
    0011.pth
    1005.pth
